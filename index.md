I am a **Ph.D. student** in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the **University of Kansas**, where I work in the **Colella Lab of Evolutionary & Ecological Genomics** and the **KU Natural History Museum & Biodiversity Institute**.  

My research explores the intersections of **evolutionary biology, parasitology, and museum-based science** to understand how mammals and their parasites respond to environmental and anthropogenic changes.  

**Research interests include:**
- Biogeography and phylogenetics  
- Hostâ€“parasite relationships  
- Adaptation to changing climates  
- Integrative conservation genomics  
- Museum specimen-based research  
- Environmental and animal ethics
